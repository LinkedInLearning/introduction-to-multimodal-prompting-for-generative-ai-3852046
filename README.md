In the last year, multimodality has brought about new capabilities to AI systems. In this course, software developer and instructor Ronnie Sheer offers you an understanding of what multimodality is and when and why it may be leveraged for business needs. Dive into a "tools approach" as Ronnie teaches you multimodality using two popular LLMs on the market: GPT-4 and Google Gemini. Plus, explore an additional chapter dedicated to prompting with and for music. Solidify all that you learn in the course, using opportunities within the course for hands-on practice.
